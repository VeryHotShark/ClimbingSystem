# ClimbingSystem

This is a Climbing System made based on an Online Course

Character can :
- Freeflow procedurally climb surfaces (Zelda Botw Style)
- Vault through/Up obstacles
- Climb Up/Down the Ledge
- Hop in 4 directions during Climb

I'm planning to Expand this to support more typical Ledge based climbing like in AC series or Uncharted.
